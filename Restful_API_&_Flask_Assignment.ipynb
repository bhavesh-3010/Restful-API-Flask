It is stateless, meaning each request contains all necessary information without relying on stored server data. RESTful APIs use structured URLs, return data in formats like JSON or XML, and often support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They are widely used for building scalable and interoperable web applications."

It is popular for API development because of its simplicity, minimalism, and ease of use. Flask follows a modular approach, allowing developers to add extensions for features like authentication, database integration, and request handling as needed. It supports RESTful API development with built-in routing, request parsing, and response formatting. Its popularity also comes from its active community, well-documented resources, and compatibility with libraries like SQLAlchemy for database management. Flask is ideal for small to medium-sized projects that require rapid development and customization."

It is defined using the `@app.route()` decorator, where `app` is the Flask application instance. When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask matches it to the corresponding route and executes the associated function. Routes can handle different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, enabling RESTful API development. Flask also supports dynamic routing, allowing variables in URLs (e.g., `@app.route('/user/<username>')`) to pass data to the function. Routing helps organize web applications by defining clear paths for different functionalities."

Initialize the database with `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`, define models as Python classes, and create tables using `db.create_all()`.
